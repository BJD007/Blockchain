Decentralized Decision-Making: Blockchain can support decentralized decision-making processes in autonomous vehicle networks, 
allowing vehicles to coordinate actions like lane changes or route optimizations without relying on a central authority.

Implementing decentralized decision-making using blockchain for autonomous vehicle networks is a complex project that requires combining various technologies, including blockchain, smart contracts, and autonomous vehicle communication protocols. Below is a high-level outline of the project, including the necessary components and sample code snippets to guide you through the implementation.

Project Components
Blockchain Platform: Use a blockchain platform like Ethereum for decentralized decision-making.
Smart Contracts: Develop smart contracts to handle coordination between vehicles.
Vehicle Communication Interface: Create an interface to enable vehicles to communicate with the blockchain and each other.
Simulation Environment: Use a simulation environment like CARLA or ROS for testing the system.
